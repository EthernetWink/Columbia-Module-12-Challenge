# Columbia-Module-12-Challenge

## Objective

What this code aims to do is make a Logistic Regression model to predict how good of a borrower someone will be. 
We split up the data and make one model with logistic regression and test it.
We print out the Balance accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. 

All of that data and proccess shows us that we made a model 100% accurate at prediciting 0 and 85% accurate at prediciting 1.

After doing the OverSampling method on our data we then test it again.
This time seeing that the only changes is in the precision in predicting 1 is 84% down from 85% by just 1.
